- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata and other non-visible elements.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Represents the visible content of the web page.
- `<header>`: Typically contains the introductory content, such as the website's logo, navigation menu, or heading.
- `<h1>`: Represents the main heading of the page.
- `<main>`: Contains the main content of the web page.
- `<section>`: Defines a standalone section within the document.
- `<h2>`: Represents a subheading within a section.
- `<p>`: Represents a paragraph of text.
- `<footer>`: Contains the footer content, such as copyright information or additional links.
Remember that this is just a basic example, and HTML structures can vary depending on the complexity and requirements of a web page.
